    <p>Hello everyone, I hope you are well, I am currently single. I previously studied business administration in my country, Peru, but I always wanted to learn to program.</p>
    <p>I am not a member of the church but I found out about this great opportunity through social media and applied to BYU IDAHO.</p>
    <p>Currently, I work in digital marketing in my own online store and I work with my family, I am 24 years old and I hope to meet several classmates, I am not very good with programming but I hope to improve.</p> 
    <p>I enjoy doing a lot of things. I welcome getting to know all of my classmates. Thank you for looking at my web page. </p>
